# raid-selector
OBS Dock + Streamer.Bot functionality to allow chat to select raid targets

## Streamer.Bot


## OBS
The UI can be imported as a custom dock into OBS. It only requires the dist files.

In OBS, go to Docks -> Custom Browser Docks, and add the following:

    Dock Name: Raid Roulette
    
    URL: http://absolute/{PATH TO THE INDEX.HTML FILE}

You may need to refresh the dock from time to time to address possible issues.
